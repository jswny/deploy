# Deploy ![Deploy](https://github.com/jswny/deploy/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to deploy apps to any server.

## Features
- Automatic deployment from GitHub actions
- Supports separate channels
- Automatically injects necessary environment variables
- Only requires SSH and Docker packaging of your app

## Requirements
- **A server with SSH, Docker, and Docker Compose** for the app to be deployed to
  - A private SSH key to be used for deployment which has been added to an appropriate user on the server. The key can **not** have a password.
- **Something to build and push a Docker image** for your app. [This Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images) is recommended.
- **A GitHub Actions workflow** to run this Action

## Usage
1. Include this Action in your workflow. For example, see [the demo version run in this repository under the `deploy` job here](https://github.com/jswny/deploy/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml).
2. Fill in the inputs as noted below.
3. Create a `Dockerfile` for your app, use any environment variables that you need injected as you would usually.
4. Copy the default `docker-compose.yml` file from `app/docker-compose.yml` or use your own. Make sure the Compose file you use conforms to the following:
    - `$IMAGE` will be injected automatically in the `.env` file for your Compose file to use, but you can hard-code your image name if you know it will not change.
    - `$CONTAINER_NAME` will be generated by the Action, so you must ensure that your Compose file uses this as the container name.
    - Any environment variables you need to pass through to your various app services are included under the `environment` key.
5. Ensure any environment variables specified in the `env_vars` input are passed into the Action via the `env` key (see the input below, and examples).
6. Make sure the Action is only triggered on the appropriate events using [`jobs.<job_id>.if`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif).

## Inputs
### `deploy_server`
| Required | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Yes** | The IP address of the SSH-enabled server to deploy to. |

### `deploy_username`
| Required | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Yes** | The username of the account associated with the provided SSH key to access on the deploy server. |

### `deploy_root_dir`
| Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Yes** | N/A | The root directory to deploy the app to on the deploy server. A subdirectory will be created inside this directory based on the channel and the repository name. The root directory will be created if it doesn't already exist. |

### `ssh_key`
| Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Yes** | N/A | The SSH key to be used to access the deploy server. |

### `path`
| Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No | `.` | The path to the directory containing your app. Relative to the current directory of your repository. |

### `env_vars`
| Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No | Empty string | A comma-separated string list of environment variables which represent the environment variables required to be injected into the app. For example, if `FOO,BAR` was passed in , the following environment variables names would be pulled from the Action environment: `FOO`, `BAR`. |

### `debug`
| Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No | `"false"` | Print extra debugging info. Specify `"false"` for false or `"true"` for true. Set to the value of `${{ secrets.actions_step_debug }}` (and set in your secrets if needed as indicated [here](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-debugging.md)) to synchronize debugging with the rest of the workflow. |

## How it Works
1. Determines the channel based on the options passed in via the appropriate inputs.
2. Finds the local Docker image in the Actions runner built by a previous step in your workflow containing the name of your repository.
3. Generates an appropriate container name based on the local image name and the channel.
4. Sets up the SSH agent inside the Actions runner using the provided SSH key.
5. Pushes the image to Docker Hub.
6. Populates a `.env` file with the appropriate environment variables required by your, and a few other environment variables such as the ones required by the Compose file.
7. Creates a directory on the remote server for the app given the current channel using the provided deploy root directory.
8. Uses SCP to send the `.env` file and the `docker-compose.yml` file to the remote server.
9. Pulls the Docker image on the remote server.
10. Brings the app up with Docker Compose in detatched mode. This will automatically restart the app if the image has changed.
